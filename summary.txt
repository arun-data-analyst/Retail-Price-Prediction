📘 Project Summary: Retail Price Prediction (Canada 2017–2025)
------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 **Objective:**
To build and evaluate machine learning models for estimating the pre-tax retail prices of Canadian products using historical data.

📊 **Dataset:**
- Kaggle: Product Retail Price Survey (2017–2025)
- Content: Prices, taxes, and product details across Canadian provinces.

📈 **Key Findings from Analysis:**
- [cite_start]**Price Inflation:** Average product prices show a consistent upward trend from 2017 to 2025[cite: 4].
- [cite_start]**High Variability:** 'Infant & Baby Products' and 'Meat & Poultry' have the widest range of prices[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]**Tax Differences:** Provinces 2 through 6 have the highest average tax rates (~15%), while Province 10 has the lowest (~5%)[cite: 3].
- [cite_start]**Top-Priced Items:** Premium beef and infant formula are consistently the most expensive products[cite: 5].

🤖 **Modeling Results:**
- [cite_start]**Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression [cite: 6]
- [cite_start]**Target Variable:** VALUE (pre-tax price) [cite: 6]

- **Linear Regression (Best Performing):**
  - RMSE: 1.24
  - R² Score: 0.94

- **Random Forest Regression:**
  - RMSE: 1.36
  - R² Score: 0.93

🧠 **Conclusion:**
Both models performed exceptionally well, but the **Linear Regression** model was slightly more accurate for this specific dataset. [cite_start]The project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for solving a real-world pricing estimation problem[cite: 9].
