📘 Project Summary – Retail Price Prediction (Canada 2017–2025)
------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Objective:
Estimate pre-tax retail prices of Canadian products using historical data and machine learning models.

📊 Dataset:
- Source: Kaggle (Product Retail Price Survey by Aradhana Hirapara)
- Records: Prices, taxes, product types across provinces from 2017 to 2025
- License: CC0 (Public Domain)

📈 Key Insights from EDA:
1. 'Infant & Baby Products' and 'Meat & Poultry' showed the highest price variability and outliers.
2. Provinces 2 to 6 had the highest average tax rates (~15%), while Province 10 had the lowest (~5%).
3. Average product prices increased steadily year by year, indicating retail price inflation.
4. Infant formula and premium beef cuts consistently ranked as the most expensive items.

🤖 Machine Learning:
- Models Used: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression (sklearn)
- Target: VALUE (pre-tax price)
- Features: Year, Month, GEO, Product Category, Products, Taxable, Essential, Total tax rate

📊 Model Evaluation:
- Linear Regression: RMSE = 1.24, R² = 0.94
- Random Forest: RMSE = 1.36, R² = 0.93

🧠 Interpretation:
- Linear Regression slightly outperformed Random Forest in this dataset.
- Random Forest offers resilience to outliers and non-linear interactions.
- Both models demonstrated strong predictive accuracy.
